Zphisher is an advanced phishing tool used for social engineering attacks. It's designed to easily create and deploy phishing pages that mimic legitimate websites, often used to harvest sensitive information such as login credentials or personal details. Built on top of the ZPHisher framework, it automates the creation of fake login pages for various popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google. While it's a useful tool for penetration testers and security researchers to assess vulnerabilities, it can also be misused for malicious purposes. As such, it's crucial to understand the ethical and legal implications of using such tools.
